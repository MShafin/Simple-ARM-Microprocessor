## About The Project
The goal for this project was to create a functional and efficient alternative to changing the names of teams on the score clock present in the gymnasium during annual basketball tournaments. Our end resulting prototype was a working LED Display that is easy to mount, use, and repair thanks to its modular design and mobile app.
